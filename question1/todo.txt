give pros
	low dimensional pca is faster
give cons
	it possibly gives fewer eigen vectors, tho this may not be a bad thing
	we don't get the picture back intantly 
difference between eigen vectors
compare differences between high and low dimensional computation. create metrics to measure and demonstrate
metrics
	time how long it takes to calculate eigenvalues
	reconstruction error
